# **myLogger Benchmark Report**

## **Benchmark Summary**
| Benchmark | Time (ns) | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Logging Performance** | **2252** | **2175** | **337001** |
| **Config Load Time** | **3823** | **3805** | **182955** |

## **Analysis**
### **1. Logging Performance**
- The average logging operation took **~2.25 Âµs (2252 ns)** per log entry.
- The CPU time per operation is slightly lower at **2175 ns**, indicating that there might be minor scheduling or thread synchronization overhead.
- The **high number of iterations (337,001)** suggests the benchmark ran long enough to capture consistent performance trends.

### **2. Config File Loading**
- Loading the configuration file takes **~3.82 Âµs (3823 ns)**.
- CPU time (3805 ns) is very close to the real time, meaning this operation is mostly CPU-bound rather than affected by I/O latency.
- With **182,955 iterations**, the test produced stable readings.

## **Suggestions & Improvements**
### **Logging Optimization**
- **Reduce Mutex Locking Overhead**: If the logger is heavily synchronized, consider batching log writes instead of locking for every log.
- **Async Improvements**: The current async logging might introduce delays due to thread synchronization; using a more optimized queue (e.g., a lock-free ring buffer) could help.

### **Config Loading Optimization**
- **Lazy Loading**: If config values arenâ€™t needed immediately, defer reading them on demand.
- **Caching Strategy**: Store parsed config values in memory instead of reading from the file each time.

## **Next Steps**
- âœ… **Compare with Other Logging Libraries (e.g., spdlog, Boost.Log)**
- âœ… **Profile the Logging System for Bottlenecks**
- âœ… **Explore Lock-Free Queue for Async Logging**
- âœ… **Consider Memory-Mapped Config Reads for Large Config Files**
